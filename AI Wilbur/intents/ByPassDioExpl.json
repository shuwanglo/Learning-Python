The problem is that if one of the cells is not working, no electric current can flow through the cell string anymore. To solve this problem there are usually 3 by-pass diodes attached to some of the cells. On the 60-cell panel, say, a diode is attached to cells 1 and 20, another one attached to 21 and 40 and the last one attached to 41 and 60. In case one or more of the cells on each 20-cell sub-string is not working, electric current can still flow through the by-pass diode attached to that sub-string."
